Hi Bob,
Yes, you can include my fonts. The license agreement is the same for all
fonts so just make sure that the users can find it fairly easily. You
might want to make it clear that users don't have to get special
permission to use my fonts in a game but I always appreciate a copy of
the final product, swag etc - if you think it's appropriate to mention
it somewhere. Your call.

Cheers,

Ray Larabie
